# Ascend: SbA (Stats by Actions) — short overview

**Ascend** turns vanilla Minecraft into a lightweight, persistent RPG: train attributes by doing things in-game, gain Ascend levels, spend points to boost combat, movement, magic and social skills, and watch those choices change how your character performs. 

**This Mod is meant to be used alongside Iron's Spells and Spellbooks but does work without it.**

## What it does (quick)

* Adds an **Ascend level & XP** system (max level **20**, **15 points per level**).
* Players earn XP from actions: killing mobs, mining certain blocks, taking damage, crafting/smelting, using potions, trading with villagers, using weapons, and periodic checks for risky situations (low health, debuffs, darkness).
* Spend earned points on 10 attributes (strength, agility, fortitude, intelligence, willpower, charisma, and weapon/magic scaling stats).
* Client UI: press **V** (configurable keybind) to open a compact stats screen and spend points. Server-authoritative with packet sync.

## Key mechanics & examples

* **Strength**: +attack damage, +knockback, and armor-bypass bonus calculated on hit.
* **Agility**: small movement speed bonus; XP for agile actions (sprinting, climbing, jumping).
* **Fortitude**: increases max health, knockback resistance, chance to resist/cleanse harmful effects.
* **Intelligence**: increases mana (and integrates with Iron’s Spellbooks if present), lengthens beneficial potion effects, reduces enchantment costs/effects.
* **Willpower**: Will be used in later mods -> Does nothing for now.
* **Charisma**: grants trade discounts by adjusting merchant offers when opening trades.
* **Scaling stats**: light/medium/heavy weapon scaling and magic scaling multiply damage based on attack speed or magic damage type.

## Playstyle & design goal

Ascend is built to be unobtrusive and organic: your playstyle trains the corresponding attributes. Want a heavy-hitter who tanks? Smash armor and spend in Strength/Fortitude. Prefer spellcasting? Farm XP and invest in Intelligence and Magic Scaling. It’s about emergent progression. No grindy menus, just meaningful choices.
